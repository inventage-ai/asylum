# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed
- Agent CLIs now build as the topmost base-image layers, after all kits, instead of first. Because agent versions change frequently (version pinning) and Docker invalidates every layer below a changed one, placing agents first meant each agent bump rebuilt the expensive kit layers (Java, Node, etc.) above them. Agents are now assembled as a block just before the tail, so a version bump rebuilds only the agent layers. The first run after upgrading triggers a one-time base-image rebuild.

### Fixed
- Scoped npm packages (e.g. `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`) in a kit's `packages` list were rejected as invalid — the package name validation did not allow a leading `@`.
- Installing node kit `packages` in the project image failed with `fnm: command not found` — the generated `npm install -g` step did not put fnm on PATH (Docker RUN does not source shell profiles).
- A project's local mise config (e.g. a `.tool-versions` pinning an uninstalled Java build) could abort container startup. The java kit's entrypoint ran `mise use --global` under `set -e` with output suppressed, so a non-zero exit killed startup with no visible cause ("container failed to start"). The command is now non-fatal and no longer hides mise's output.

### Added
- `--debug` now traces the container entrypoint (`set -x`). The entrypoint runs under `set -e` and aborts silently on a failing command, so a startup failure left no clue beyond the last successful log line. The trace is captured in `docker logs` and dumped automatically when a container fails to start, pinpointing the command that died.
- Agent version tracking — asylum fetches the latest version of each coding agent and injects it as a per-agent `ARG` directive in the Dockerfile, so a new upstream release cache-busts only that agent's install layer. Versions are fetched concurrently on first run, cached in `~/.asylum/versions.json`, and refreshed in the background.
- Ad-hoc agents in a configured project — running `asylum -a <agent>` for an agent the project's container doesn't have no longer fails or rebuilds the existing container. Instead asylum starts a separate container (named for the project plus agent set) alongside it. Secondary containers forward no ports; bake the agent into project/user config to give it a first-class container with ports.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-06-23

Two new coding agents land — GitHub Copilot CLI and Pi — alongside agent companions, which let a Claude Code session reach other agents' CLIs (e.g. the codex plugin) without launching them. The headline behaviour change: `asylum` no longer auto-resumes the previous session by default — it starts fresh, with resume now opt-in via `--continue`/`--resume` or `default-resume: true`. Launching from your home directory or filesystem root is now caught and redirected into a fresh sandboxable workspace instead of failing.

### Added
- GitHub Copilot CLI coding agent support (`copilot` agent option). Sessions are detected via `~/.copilot/session-state/`, resumed via `--resume`. When the `github` kit is active, copilot picks up the host's `gh` token automatically via the launch wrapper (`GH_TOKEN` exported from `gh auth token`).
- Pi coding agent support (`pi` agent option, installed via npm through fnm).
- Agent companions: `agents.<name>.companions` mounts other agents' config dirs and env vars into the container at runtime without launching them, enabling Claude Code plugins that shell out to other agent CLIs (e.g. the codex plugin).
- `asylum-openspec-init`: a bundled container script that initializes OpenSpec non-interactively with Asylum's preferred profile (`custom` with `verify` instead of `sync`) and the active agent's toolset. Idempotent (refreshes an existing setup). The agent runs it automatically when asked to use OpenSpec in an uninitialized project; the openspec kit also seeds the preferred global config and exposes the active agent via the `ASYLUM_AGENT` env var.
- Launching `asylum` from your home directory or the filesystem root (which can't be safely sandboxed) now redirects into a fresh workspace under `~/asylum-workspace/<date>-<three-words>/` instead of attempting to mount your entire home tree. The new path is announced on start.
- `--continue` and `--resume` flags are now forwarded verbatim to the underlying agent (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Pi). Use them to opt explicitly into the previous session.
- `default-resume: true` config key restores the old auto-resume behaviour. Honoured at the global, project, and local config layers.
- One-time upgrade dialog on the next interactive `asylum` invocation after this release, explaining the breaking default-flip below and offering to set `default-resume: true` automatically. Shown once; new installations skip it entirely.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `asylum` (agent mode) now starts a new agent session by default. Pre-this-release behaviour auto-resumed when a prior session existed; resume is now opt-in via `--continue`/`--resume` or `default-resume: true`. `-n/--new` is kept as a recognised no-op so existing scripts continue to parse.
- Default agent config isolation flipped from `isolated` to `shared` — the wizard pre-selects "Shared with host" and the implicit default (non-interactive / unset config) now points at the host's native config dir. Set `agents.<name>.config: isolated` to restore the previous behaviour.
- First-run experience: a single wizard now runs before the image build instead of after, and asks which coding agents and top-level kits to bake into the image (in addition to the existing isolation / credentials questions). Pressing enter through every step yields today's defaults. Subsequent runs skip the agents/kits questions.
- `ssh-keygen` no longer spams the terminal on first container start. The randomart and "Add this key to your Git host" preamble are gone; asylum prints a single line pointing at the in-container `asylum-reference.md`, which now includes the key-usage guidance.
- A single "Building sandbox image — this takes a few minutes the first time" line prints before any actual `docker build`, so first-run users aren't staring at silence. Suppressed when both images are cache hits.

### Fixed
- Cache directory volumes (`~/.gradle`, `~/.m2`, `~/.npm`, `~/.cache/pip`) are now correctly owned by the container user, fixing agent write failures introduced when caches switched to named Docker volumes.
- `fd` is now available under its canonical name in the container (Debian ships the binary as `fdfind`); `file` is now installed in the base image.
- `--agent <name>` now always includes that agent in the image build, even when not listed in the config file.

## 0.6.6 — 2026-04-20

Shared-mode hygiene and kit revivals. Kit-provided Claude skills (`agent-browser`, `ast-grep`) are no longer bind-mounted over the user's `~/.claude/skills/` — they're loaded from inside the container via Claude's `--add-dir` flag, so the host directory stays untouched. The `rtk` kit works again against current upstream rtk releases. Alongside: a new `~/.agents` host mount, `.yaml`-extension config files, a lowered default port range, and several credential and config-merge fixes.

### Added
- Mount host `~/.agents` directory into the container in shared agent mode, so host-installed skills that symlink into `~/.agents/` resolve inside the container (#24)
- Project config files now accept a `.yaml` extension alias (`.asylum.yaml`, `.asylum.local.yaml`) so editors apply YAML syntax highlighting; `.asylum` and `.asylum.local` remain the defaults (#15)
- Security model documentation page describing what asylum protects against and its deliberate non-goals

### Changed
- Ports kit now allocates starting at port 7001 instead of 10000 — most browsers block access to the 10000+ range. Projects with an existing allocation at or above 10000 are automatically reassigned a new range on their next session.

### Fixed
- Kit-provided Claude skills (`agent-browser`, `ast-grep`) no longer create empty directories in the user's host `~/.claude/skills/` in shared agent-config mode. Skills are now staged under `/opt/asylum-skills` inside the container and loaded via `--add-dir`. Users may safely remove any existing empty `~/.claude/skills/agent-browser/` or `~/.claude/skills/ast-grep/` directories left over from previous versions. (#24, #25)
- `rtk` kit works again with recent rtk versions. Newer `rtk init -g` no longer creates a `~/.claude/hooks/` directory and instead expects the hook to be registered as the command `rtk hook claude` in `settings.json`. The kit now follows that pattern: the obsolete hook-script mounting is gone, and the entrypoint registers `rtk hook claude` directly as the PreToolUse hook command. The shared-mode pollution of the host `~/.claude/settings.json` tracked in #29 is not addressed by this change.
- Java kit now honors the configured `versions` list instead of always installing JDK 17, 21, and 25 (#26)
- Kit credential configuration in overlay config files (`.asylum`, `.asylum.local`) was silently dropped during config merge (#28)
- Credential config changes did not trigger the stale container warning because kit credentials were excluded from the config hash (#28)
- Shadow `node_modules` volume chown used a hardcoded `claude` user name instead of the actual container UID, breaking permissions for hosts with a different username

## 0.6.5 — 2026-04-01

macOS binaries are now code-signed and notarized, eliminating Gatekeeper warnings for users downloading asylum from GitHub Releases. All release binaries now include SHA256 checksums and GitHub build provenance attestation for supply chain verification.

### Added
- macOS code signing with Developer ID certificate and Apple notarization for darwin binaries
- SHA256 checksums file (`checksums.txt`) published with every release
- GitHub build provenance attestation for all release binaries
- Checksum verification in install script with graceful fallback

### Changed
- Release and dev-release workflows split into platform-specific build jobs with a shared reusable workflow for darwin signing

## 0.6.4 — 2026-04-01

Fixes the rtk kit failing to build due to the `rtk` binary not being on PATH during Docker image assembly.

### Fixed
- rtk kit Docker build failure — the install script places `rtk` in `~/.local/bin/` which isn't on PATH in non-interactive Docker `RUN` commands

## 0.6.3 — 2026-04-01

Asylum now detects when a running container's image is stale after config changes and automatically restarts it, fixing the common issue where kit packages added to a project config were silently ignored. Also fixes container startup freezes and mise config trust errors.

### Added
- Stale container detection — asylum checks if the running container's image matches the current config and restarts automatically when no active sessions exist, or prompts when sessions are active
- Config drift warning when volumes, env vars, or ports change on a running container

### Fixed
- Kit packages from project config not triggering project image rebuild (#16)
- Container startup appearing to freeze for 60 seconds when the container crashes immediately — now fails fast with logs
- Tab state lost when switching tabs in `asylum config` TUI
- Untrusted `mise.toml` in project directory crashing the entrypoint under `set -e` — mise configs are now auto-trusted

## 0.6.2 — 2026-04-01

Adds `asylum config` for post-setup kit and credential management, replaces the SSH init command with an always-on SSH kit, and renames the browser kit to `agent-browser` backed by Vercel's agent-browser tool.

### Added
- `asylum config` command — interactive tabbed TUI for managing kits, credentials, and isolation settings after initial setup
- SSH is now an always-on kit with configurable `isolation` (isolated/shared/project) — keys are generated automatically on first container start, replacing the manual `asylum ssh-init` command
- New `rtk` kit (opt-in) — installs [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) token-reduction proxy that compresses shell command output, reducing LLM token usage by 60-90%
- Sandbox rules file lists disabled kits with a reference to the asylum-reference doc for activation instructions

### Changed
- Browser kit renamed from `browser` to `agent-browser`, now backed by [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) instead of Playwright — Claude Code skill generated at build time; the old `browser:` config key still works as an alias
- New kit activation prompt uses TUI multiselect instead of per-kit Y/n text prompts — all new kits shown in one batch with descriptions, default-on kits pre-selected
- ast-grep kit now generates and mounts the upstream Claude Code skill for better rule authoring
- Dockerfile instruction ordering optimized for layer caching — faster rebuilds when only later layers change
- `apt` and `shell` kits hidden from interactive selection UIs

### Fixed
- Container not stopping after session exit when a previous session ended abnormally — replaced file-based session counter with runtime exec session detection
- Docker mount failure when agent config dir is a symlink
- Kit activation via `SyncKitToConfig` mangling config.yaml indentation, comments, and whitespace
- Tilde (`~`) not expanded in volume destination paths, causing Docker mount errors
- Release notification dropping last changelog section

### Removed
- `asylum ssh-init` command (replaced by the SSH kit's automatic key generation)

## 0.6.1 — 2026-03-30

Patch release fixing Docker volume mounting issues on some Docker Desktop versions and a spurious kit sync message for new users.

### Fixed
- Nested bind mount failure on some Docker Desktop versions
- Kit sync messages shown to users without a config file

## 0.6.0 — 2026-03-29

This release introduces the kit system — modular, composable tooling profiles that replace hardcoded language toolchains with a flexible, extensible architecture. Each kit owns its Dockerfile snippets, entrypoint setup, config defaults, credentials, and agent rules. Also adds Claude config isolation, a documentation site, and aligns the container user with the host identity.

### Added
- Kit system: modular tooling profiles (java, python, node, docker, github, shell, etc.) that own Dockerfile snippets, entrypoint setup, cache dirs, config defaults, and agent rules — replaces hardcoded language toolchains
- Config format v2: per-kit options replace top-level `features`, `packages`, `versions` fields; v1 configs migrated automatically
- Hierarchical sub-kits: `java/maven`, `java/gradle`, `node/pnpm`, `node/yarn` with kit dependencies and activation tiers (always-on/default/opt-in)
- New kits: `ast-grep` (AST-based code search), `browser` (Chromium via Playwright), `cx` (semantic code navigation), `ports` (automatic per-project port allocation)
- Kit credential system: auto-discovers and filters host credentials by project needs — Maven discovers server IDs from `pom.xml`; GitHub extracts `gh` auth token from host keyrings
- Kit config sync: new kits detected on startup and offered for activation, preserving comments and user edits in config
- Configurable agent CLI installation via `agents` config map and `--agents` flag; Opencode agent support
- Claude config isolation: `shared` (host config), `isolated`, or `project` (per-project) via onboarding wizard or `agents.claude.config`; session detection (`--continue`) works across all modes
- Onboarding wizard: config isolation and credential prompts grouped into a multi-step TUI wizard; declining persists the choice to prevent repeat prompts
- Documentation site with MkDocs Material, versioned via mike with `dev` and `latest` channels
- Sandbox rules and reference doc injected into containers, giving agents awareness of available tools and environment
- `cleanup --all` for global cleanup (all images, volumes, cached data) with confirmation prompt
- Host IP accessible inside containers via `host.docker.internal`
- `self-update` accepts optional version argument (e.g., `asylum self-update 0.4.0`); `selfupdate` accepted as alias
- E2e test suite with echo agent for full binary lifecycle testing

### Changed
- Container user now matches host user (username, UID, GID, home directory) instead of hardcoded `claude:1000:/home/claude`
- Container names now include project name: `asylum-<hash>-<project>` with automatic data migration
- `cleanup` scopes to current project by default; `cleanup` and `version` promoted from flags to subcommands (flag aliases kept)
- Cleanup and onboarding prompts skipped in non-interactive mode; cleanup preserves active sessions
- `docker exec` only uses `-t` flag when stdin is a TTY

### Fixed
- Broken terminal colors in macOS Terminal.app caused by hardcoded `COLORTERM=truecolor`; now inherited from host
- `.tool-versions` Java version correctly overrides global config but not project-local config
- Config file edits no longer strip blank lines and comments via yaml round-tripping
- `ParseVolume` rejects empty host/container paths and validates mount options
- Race condition in session counter file locking; underflow no longer triggers premature container removal
- Cyclic symlinks and symlinks to regular files in `copyDir` handled correctly
- Signal forwarding goroutine no longer leaks after docker process exits
- Shell metacharacters in onboarding commands properly quoted
- Env var values with newlines rejected; run commands with newlines/empty values rejected during Dockerfile generation
- Self-update HTTP requests have 60s timeout and enforce Content-Length/512MB size limit
- `WriteDefaults` uses O_EXCL to prevent TOCTOU race on first-run config creation

## 0.5.0 — 2026-03-24

### Added
- First-run onboarding: prompts to mount package manager credentials (Maven) on initial setup
- Project onboarding framework: scans for setup tasks, prompts once, executes via `docker exec` with proper error handling
- Node.js dependency auto-install as first onboarding task (disable with `onboarding: { npm: false }`)
- `--skip-onboarding` CLI flag to skip all onboarding tasks for a single invocation
- Onboarding state tracking in `~/.asylum/projects/` — skips completed tasks unless lockfile changes
- `onboarding` config section for per-task control; `features: { onboarding: false }` for global disable

### Changed
- Cache directories (npm, pip, maven, gradle) now use named Docker volumes instead of bind mounts for better IO on macOS

### Fixed
- Tilde (`~`) in volume shorthand (e.g. `~/.m2/settings.xml:ro`) now correctly expands to `/home/claude` inside the container instead of the host home directory
- `.tool-versions` with `java 25` no longer triggers "missing" warning (switched from temurin-prefixed to plain version numbers)
- Set `COLORTERM` and `TERM` env vars for proper color support in container

## 0.4.0 — 2026-03-19

### Added
- Shadow `node_modules` with named Docker volumes to isolate container from host-built native binaries (disable with `features: { shadow-node-modules: false }`)
- `--cleanup` now also removes asylum-managed Docker volumes
- Multiple concurrent sessions per project — all modes (agent, shell, run) exec into a running container
- Container automatically cleaned up when the last session exits (file-based session counter)
- Integration tests for detached container lifecycle and multi-session behavior

### Changed
- Container starts detached with idle process; all sessions use `docker exec` instead of `docker run`

### Fixed
- fnm not found in interactive shell (missing from PATH in bashrc/zshrc)

## 0.3.3 — 2026-03-18

### Added
- Set terminal tab title on container start (default `🤖 projectname`, configurable via `tab-title` with `{project}`, `{agent}`, `{mode}` placeholders)
- Dev channel self-update shows commit count and recent commit messages
